The name India is derived from Indus, which originates from the Old Persian word Hindus. The 
latter term stems from the Sanskrit word Sindhu, which was the historical local appellation for 
the Indus River. The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi,which translates as "the 
people of the Indus".[16] The geographical term Bharat  which is recognised by the Constitution 
of India as an official name for the country, is used by many Indian languages in its variations.[17] 
The eponym of Bharat is Bharata, a theological figure that Hindu scriptures describe as a 
legendary emperor of ancient India. Hindustan was originally a Persian word that meant "Land 
of the Hindus"; prior to 1947, it referred to a region that encompassed northern India and 
Pakistan. It is occasionally used to solely denote India in its entirety
